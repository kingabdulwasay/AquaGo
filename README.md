AquaGo — Minimal Uber-like UI (HTML & CSS)

This small static project provides an Uber-like user interface built with only HTML and CSS. It contains multiple pages that represent common flows: landing, login, signup, booking, driver signup, ride history, and support.

Files
- index.html — landing / request ride
- login.html — login form
- signup.html — signup form
- booking.html — booking flow
- driver.html — become a driver
- history.html — ride history
- support.html — support / faq
- css/styles.css — shared stylesheet

How to view
Open any *.html file in a browser. On Windows you can double-click a page or run (PowerShell):

  Start-Process index.html

Notes
- This UI is static; interactive behavior like maps, auth, and backend integration are omitted intentionally.
- Accessibility: basic focus states and semantic structure included.
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints are present in the stylesheet.
